# Welcome to the Basic Sheep Database API

## THE STACK:
This application is build using a MERN (Mongodb, Express, React, and Nodejs) stack. It makes calls to a custom sheep api as well and a public quotable random quote generator api to generate random mottos of each sheep

## RUNNING:
To run the application, please download nodejs and navigate to the backend folder in the Sheep directory. Then use 'npm install' to install all dependencies. From here you can run the backend server using 'npm start'

Then open a separate terminal and navigate to the frontend folder in the Sheep directory. Use 'npm install' to install all dependencies once more and then 'npm start' to run the frontend server.

## EXTENSIONS:
The application could be further extended to add full CRUD operations, including Deletes and Update capablities. Furthermore, the frontend currently does not allow for the searching of a sheep by id, although the functionality is supported on the backend. Multipage and authenticative methodogies could be used to implemented the aforementioned features.

## DEPLOYMENT:
The application could be deployed by having the server and frontend hosted on a cloud server such as AWS or Microsoft Azure. Doing so would only require container software such as Docker to setup environment variables and dependencies and then nodejs to fully deploy the applicaiton on the cloud server.
